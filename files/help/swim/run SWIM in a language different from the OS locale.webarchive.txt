Both integrations are sensitive to the OS locale, so that if you switch from one locale to another, the integrations' dialogs will display the correct localized text.
 
At times you may want to force the integration to use a language that is different from the OS.  For example, if the OS is set to "German (Germany"), but you want the integration dialogs to display in English.
 
This is easily done by editing the ipemrunnersoa.bat file (for iPEM) or the swimrunner.bat file (for SWIM), and adding a line like this at the end of the section where the %ARGS% variable is set:
 
set ARGS=%ARGS% -Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US
 
If you want to force the integration's GUI to Chinese, use this:
 
set ARGS=%ARGS% -Duser.language=zh -Duser.country=CN
 
and so on .  .
