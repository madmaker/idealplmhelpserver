Teamcenter Integration for SolidWorks Version 9.2.0

Please review the Installation Guide, available after unzipping the
distribution, for software pre-requisites.

The Teamcenter Integration for SolidWorks works with Teamcenter
Teamcenter Unified Tc8.3.0, Tc9.1.0 and later
versions of each.

The Integration supports Solidworks 2011 2012 and 2013.  Both
32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported.

The Integration's minimum required  SolidWorks service packs are the following:
   2011 SP0
   2012 SP0
   2013 SP1

Please note that if upgrading from Teamcenter Engineering to Teamcenter
Unified (TcU 2007.1, Tc8, Tc8.1, Tc8.3), then version 7.0.0 or 7.1.0 of the Teamcenter
Integration for SolidWorks must be installed on the Teamcenter Engineering
database prior to the upgrade. This will ensure that the proper Integration data
types are defined prior to the upgrade.

Supported platform information is available on GTAC by searching the
Certification Database in the Online Library at:

Teamcenter Integration for SolidWorks Release Notes

ENHANCEMENTS IN VERSION 9.2.0
 * Significant changes have been made to the update model operation.  In version
   9.2.0 of the integration the update of models is based on revision rule.
   The change makes it easier to work on large stuctures opened with specific
   revision rules.  For more information see the AdminGuide.pdf.

 * (ER6769055) Lightweight models are now displayed in the Teamcenter task pane within
   SolidWorks.  Most right mouse button (RMB) operations are supported for the
   lightweight models, including update model.  Attributes cannot be updated
   for lightweight models nor can they be saved.  They will not appear in the
   save dialog.

 * The 9.2.0 version of the integration now supports SolidWorks 2013.  It is
   recommended to use SP2.0 for the best performance. Support for SolidWorks
   2010 has been deprecated.

 * The SWIM 9.2.0 version of the integration added sw.configurations.keep
   preference for improved management of configuration.  Patterns can be defined
   to control the configurations to be managed in Teamcenter.  The preference
   is a counter-part to sw.configurations.hide.

 * SWIM 9.2.0 version of the integration has changed the default attribute
   mappings in the swim.xml.  The old mapping of model description to Item
   description has been removed.  Instead model description is now mapped
   to Item Name and Item Revision Name with Item Revision name being
   bi-directional.  The new mappings better align to Teamcenter use of Item
   Name.  Additionally revision is mapped back to the SolidWorks model to
   enable designers to know the revision directly within the cad file.  While
   making this improvement, Description was removed from the Create New dialog.  For
   sites that use the OOTB attribute mapping for Item Name, the description will
   be populated from the mapping.

 * (ER1861806) SWIM configuration in Multi-Site environment.  With earlier
   versions of the integration it was challenging for sites to transfer all
   configurations of a document from one site to another because the transfer
   of ownership could not identify the configurations.  The SWIM 9.2.0
   version of the integration creates SW2_configuration relationships when a
   document and configuration are both saved to Teamcenter.  The relationship
   goes from the master documents dataset to the Item Revision of the
   configuration.  By configuring the new SW2_configuration and
   SWIM_master_dependency relationship into the Teamcenter transfer of ownership
   the complete ownership of document and all configurations can be transferred.
   Sites with existing data can upgrade their data by running the upgrade utility.
   See the AdminGuide.pdf.

 * (ER1895825) Non SolidWorks files (saved as auxiliary files) are not deleted
   from work folder.  The SWIM 9.2.0 version of the integration removes all
   auxiliary files once the save operation is complete.

 * (ER6733696) sw.configurations.default=none: the Add Configurations button
   should be removed.  A new preference sw.configurations.addbutton can be
   configured to remove the add button from save and open dialogs.  Review
   swim.properties documentation for details.

 * (ER6567269) SWIM 8.2.2 - Advanced Search panel - remove default "search"
   panel.  The advanced search dialog in the SWIM 9.2.0 version of the
   integration only contains the Teamcenter searches.  The general searches
   were removed and are now supported through a dropdown on the open dialog.
   The drop down contains Item, Item Name, Dataset, and Dataset Type searches.

 * (ER6569525) - SWIM 8.2.2 - Teamcenter/Advanced Searches do not come in
   specified order.  SWIM 9.2.0 version of the integration orders the advanced
   searched by the order specified in iman.querries.allowed preference.  Learn
   more by reading swim.properties.

 * iman.autorevise.configurations default has been changed from never to prompt.
   This was done to ensure user is given a choice on how to revise
   configurations.

 * Installations on Teamcenter 9.1 or later can obtain minor performance
   improvements by setting the iman.metacache.enabled preference.  Meta cache
   is not supported with older versions of Teamcenter so preference should not
   be enabled.

 * In version 9.2.0 of the integration, the update directory dialog show the
   full path to the directory being updated.  Earlier versions only displayed
   the name of the last folder.

 * (ER6800622) - Need different icon to distinguish modification from new model
   in save dialog.  New models have a Teamcenter modified icon without pencil as
   do un-modified models being saved to new Item Revisions.  Models that exist
   in Teamcenter, that have been modified locally show the Teamcenter modified
   icon (with pencil)

 * (ER6837512) - IPEM - ADS - Unable to change program from IPEM interface.
   In the 9.2.0 version of the integration, it is now possible to change the
   Teamcenter project on the user settings dialog.

 * (ER6439033 & ER6798925) - SWIM 8.2 - Need preview funcationality in the Save
   dialog in SWIM.  In version 9.2.0 a preview flyover is available in the save
   dialog.  Pause the cursor over any row and the flyover will contain an image
   of the model.  If a * appears before the model name, then the image does not
   represent the model in session, instead the image represents the model
   on disk.

 * The default filters have been changed.  At this time only "required" and
   "include drawings" appear on initial installation of the 9.2.0 version of
   the integration.  "Required" is checked by default.  Additionally, when
   no filter is checked implied drawings (those in the same Item Revision) will
   be filter out.  These changes were done to make the filtering understandable
   to first time users.

 * (ER1736404) Delete Files After Save option should cause auxiliary files to
   be deleted (not just SolidWorks models).  Version 9.2.0 of the integration
   deletes auxiliary files created during save.

NEW FIXED ISSUES in Version 9.2.0
 * (PR6765759) Testing patch for PR 6728358 reveals SWIM update in session
   performance issue.  The performance of updating the models in session has
   been improved.  Additionally the version 9.2.0 version of the update
   models command now supports lightweight models

 * (PR1919111) SolidWorks Integration does not import JT-Files.
   In earlier versions of the integration JT did not always get imported
   correctly for configurations or documents with non-default configurations.
   The 9.2.0 version of the integration correctly imports the JT files.

 * (PR1922134) SWIM9.1: If SWIM is started in Non-English language, pb with
   date attribute.  The date widget on the save dialog did not work in a
   Non-English environment.  Version 9.2.0 of the integration resolves the
   problem.

 * (PR6806148) - Documentation fix: Remove references to Pro/ENGINEER in SWIM
   AdminGuide.pdf.  Pro/ENGINEER references have been removed in the version
   9.2.0 of the integration AdminGuide.pdf.

 * (PR1922121 & PR6831454) SWIM: Mapping "item_desc" to a SWX custom prop.
   won't honor "cadtopdm" direction.  Configuration specific properties
   and evaluated properties on Configuration sometimes mapped to Teamcenter
   as the document values.  The 9.2.0 version of the integration obtains
   the correct configuration specific values.

 * (PR1930209) Solid Works Integration: Boolean property always true
   The integration was not honoring Boolean default value.  The 9.2.0 version
   of the integration reads the Teamcenter property default and displays
   it properly in the Save and Create new dialogs.

 * (PR1930704 & PR6853402) SWIM presentations of nested LOV's are disordered
   when using version 9.1.0 of the integration some cascading LOV's appeared
   on the Save and Create new dialog incorrectly.  The child LOV's could
   appear under the wrong parent property.  Version 9.2.0 of the integration
   corrects the display of cascading LOV's.

 * (PR6848080) Editing Item Rev to new value in Save dialog performs Save
   action when 'Entered'.  Version 9.2.0 of the save dialog ensures that
   selecting enter while entering a revision does not initiate a save button
   click action.  Similar corrections have been made to other fields and on
   the create new dialog.

 * (PR1927686) SWIM: Losing CO state if an there is an error during save process.
   Version 9.2.0 of the integration will retain the checkout of models when an
   attribute error occurs.  Other errors may still result in a lost checkout.

 * (PR6827391) Some item types not available when saving thru swim
   This only occurred when the display rules were different by group.  Version
   9.2.0 properly displays the types based on the group specific display rules.

 * (PR2210297) SWIM 9.1 - Not honoring property constant Enabled set to false
   Version 9.2.0 handles property constant set to false.  The implementation
   is a workaround for a core Teamcenter issue.  The actual PR has been
   assigned to core Teamcenter to resolve correctly.

 * (PR1920732) Attribute Mapping with a list of values - only the first value
   is mapped to SW.  This was not an issue with LOV's, but instead a problem
   with strings attributes that contained semicolons.  Text after the first
   semicolon was lost.  Version 9.2.0 of the integration handles the semicolon's
   correctly.

 * (PR6801866 & PR1918300) - trying to save to teamcenter from swim
   A java.lang.NullPointerException occurred when Teamcenter option
   ItemCreation.NoMasterFrom is set or access to master forms is otherwise
   restricted.  Version 9.2.0 of the integrations avoids the exception and
   save can be completed by the user.

 * (PR6805073) SWIM 9.1 Bulk Import tool causes attribute mapping to fail
   The error was specific to SolidWorks evaluated attributes such as:
   $PRP:"DESCRIPTION1".  Version 9.2.0 of the Bulk import tool handles
   evaluated attributes.

 * (PR6795039) SWIM 8.3.1 save fails with Custom Basic Units set to
   "Feet & Inches".  The integration had never been updated to support this
   custom unit.  Version 9.2.0 of the integration retrieves the units
   correctly.

 * (PR1916571) SWIM-Plugin causes SolidWorks to crash while using
   "Broken-Out-Section" command.  The 9.2.0 version of the integration
   avoids the crash.

 * (PR6757049) SWIM Usage issue
   When using the Teamcenter task pane to checkin a drawing, the dependent
   model was not selected for checkin.  However performing the same actions
   through Teamcenter save operation resulted in both model being selected for
   save.  With Version 9.2.0 of the integration both operations result in both
   drawing and child parts being selected for checkin.

 * (PR1903324) After installing SWIM 8.3.1 Sw performnace in daily work features
   goes slower.  The performance of SolidWorks functionality was caused by
   notifiers the integration uses to monitor user actions.  The notifiers
   stored information to improve the performance of integration operations.
   The version 9.2.0 integration improves performance of SolidWorks operations,
   but the Teamcenter save will be a bit slower on large datasets.

 * (PR6655756) IMAN_capture relation not honored for PDF upload
   As installed, the integration was using IMAN_capture relation for PDF files.
   IMAN_capture relations are not visible to OOTB Teamcenter, so users could
   not see the PDF files.  Version 9.2.0 of the integration uses IMAN_rendering
   for PDF files.  Sites already using IMAN_capture can continue to use
   IMAN_capture or switch to using IMAN_rendering.
